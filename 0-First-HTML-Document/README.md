# 0 Getting Started

This tutorial series assumes that you know how to navigate around your computer. This includes doing things like navigating
through folders and moving files around.

If you aren't already familiar with this, don't worry, you can learn more here:

## 0.1 Obtaining a text editor
When writing software, one must use a text editor. A text editor is a program similar to Microsoft Word. Except that instead
of editing documents, we will be editing text files. We will be using an editor called Atom throughout this entire tutorial.

Atom is a text editor created by Github that offers a bunch of great features for creating websites. You can download atom here:
[Atom](http://atom.io).

Download Atom for your appropriate operating system and run the installer.
After you have installed atom, create a new file by going to File -> New File.

## 0.2 Your first HTML file
Create a new folder on your computer wherever you'd like and call it HelloWorld. Now,
copy and paste the following text into Atom:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset=UTF-8>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Next we are going to save the file in your HelloWorld folder.
Go to File -> Save as... and navigate to the HelloWorld folder. Give the file the name helloworld.html.

Now open the file in your web browser, and you have now created your first website!
Don't worry if you don't understand what is going on in helloworld.html, that's what the next tutorial is for!
